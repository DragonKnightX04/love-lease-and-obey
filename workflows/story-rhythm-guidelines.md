# 📅 Story Rhythm Guidelines --- *Love, Lease & Obey*

This document outlines the recommended pacing and character rotation
rhythm for infinite episodic storytelling.\
Following this rhythm ensures character arcs develop naturally, readers
feel rewarded with updates, and new tenants are introduced in a
controlled, exciting way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Core Character Rotation Framework

### 🔹 Anchor Characters

-   Maintain 3--4 "anchor" couples or key characters who appear
    regularly.\
-   They form the backbone of ongoing arcs.\
-   Return to each anchor couple every **3--5 episodes** for progress or
    tension escalation.

### 🔹 Secondary Characters

-   Rotate in secondary couples or new tenants for variety.\
-   These characters can be promoted to anchors based on reader
    engagement or storyline momentum.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔄 Episode-Level Rotation Guide

  Episode      Focus
  ------------ -------------------------------------------------
  Episode 0    Introduce first anchor couple
  Episode 1    New secondary pairing in a different location
  Episode 2    Check back on Episode 0 couple (anchor update)
  Episode 3    Introduce a new wildcard tenant
  Episode 4    Escalate tension with another anchor couple
  Episode 5    Cross-pollination or location-based scenario
  Episode 6    Secondary couple update
  Episode 7    Optional new tenant introduction
  Episode 8    Anchor couple vulnerability breakthrough
  Episode 9    One-off comedic disaster episode
  Episode 10   Building-wide event / multi-character collision

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧩 New Tenant Introduction

-   Introduce a **new tenant every 5--7 episodes** on average.\
-   Use narrative hooks:
    -   Mistaken package deliveries\
    -   Building "Welcome Glitch" events\
    -   Social notifications showing compatibility scores
-   New tenants can:
    -   Disrupt existing dynamics\
    -   Become future anchor couples\
    -   Serve as comedic chaos agents

## 🕰️ Arc Length Recommendations

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Arc Type            Typical Length        Key Beats
                      (Episodes)            
  ------------------- --------------------- ------------------------------
  Slow-burn romance   5--7 episodes         Awkward start → Escalation →
                                            Vulnerability → Partial payoff

  Rivalry / Enmity    3--5 episodes         Initial clash → Building
  arcs                                      sabotage → Mutual humiliation

  Secret Exposure     2--3 episodes         Subtle hints → Near reveal →
  arcs                                      Public fallout
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📈 Building-Wide Escalation Events

-   Every **10 episodes**, run a mass glitch event (building party
    sabotage, public leaderboard mishaps, community surveys that leak
    secrets).\
-   These episodes cross multiple arcs and reset tensions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🔎 Summary

-   Keep readers engaged with rhythmic returns to characters they care
    about.\
-   Balance fresh chaos with long-term arc progression.\
-   Use structured randomness for maximum soap-opera effect.\
-   Wildcards create excitement; anchor couples build loyalty.
