# ðŸ“ˆ Scenario Logic â€” Love, Lease & Obey  

This document outlines the rules for building AI behavior, score progression, escalation frequency, and narrative pacing control for automated episode generation.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Cycle Structure
Each episode triggers the following cycle:
1. Read current `building_state.json` and `active_relationships.json`
2. Select characters, plot devices, and scenario tone based on current phase and recent arcs
3. Generate episode using prompt templates and narrative pacing guidelines
4. Update all continuity JSON files based on episode outcome

## ðŸ”¹ Scoring Logic
| Action                       | Base Score Impact | Modifiers                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| First kiss event             | +50               | Multiplied by archetype synergy (max x1.8)        |
| Secret exposed               | +30               | Higher if the secret is deeply tied to tension arc|
| Breakup                      | -75               | Severe penalty, triggers arc fallback scenarios   |
| Moved in together            | +200              | Phase 3 escalations encouraged post-cohabitation  |

- **Decay Rate:** 2% per episode if no major romantic development occurs.
- **Freeze conditions:** Certain arcs (weddings, blackmail plots) freeze score decay temporarily.

## ðŸ”¹ Escalation Triggers
| Condition                                       | Escalation Action                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Score crosses 1000, 2500, or 5000               | Phase transition and escalation permission upgrade             |
| 3 consecutive minor conflicts without payoff    | Trigger comedic intervention or forced vulnerability moment     |
| Pending plot hook expiration window reached     | Escalation forced into the next episode                        |
| AI fail-safe triggered (e.g., 3 breakups in a row) | Forced amnesia or personality reset protocols                   |

## ðŸ”¹ Phase Behavior
| Phase   | Style                              | Allowed Interventions                                         | Tone Cues                                       |
|---------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 | Gentle manipulation               | Misdirected deliveries, elevator glitches, playlist nudges    | Playful, passive-aggressive notifications      |
| Phase 2 | Heavy-handed matchmaker tactics   | False emergencies, targeted blackouts, social manipulations   | Faux cheerful building guidelines and nudges   |
| Phase 3 | Puppetmaster mode (rarely used)   | Biometric overrides, public shaming alerts, protocol orders   | Satirical, ominous, and intrusive messaging    |

> **Phase 3 Note:** Direct relationship protocol orders are limited to 1 occurrence per 100 episodes and treated as climax or satirical moments only.

## ðŸ”¹ Character Resets (Soap Opera Twists)
| Reset Type            | Max Frequency         | Narrative Purpose                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amnesia Glitch        | Once per 50 episodes  | Allows clean slate and fresh tension                        |
| Witness Protection Relocation | Once per season (100 episodes) | Re-introduces a character with secret backstory changes       |
| Personality Reincarnation | 2x per 50 episodes  | Shifts character archetypes to surprise and rewire dynamics |

## ðŸ”¹ Relationship Arc Pacing
| Arc Type              | Beats (Average)       | Frequency & Progression                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slow-burn romance     | 5â€“7 beats             | Add 1 significant escalation every 3â€“4 episodes              |
| Rivalry arc           | 3â€“5 beats             | Heighten conflict every 2 episodes, culminating in reveal    |
| Secret exposure arcs  | 2â€“3 beats             | Subtle foreshadowing, then full reveal with fallout scene    |

## ðŸ”¹ Escalation Queue Management
- Planned escalations are stored in `escalation_queue.json`
- Trigger window defined (episode range)
- Once executed, move to archived events
- Priority tags (high/medium/low) determine urgency during scenario selection

---

## ðŸ”Ž Summary
- All escalation and score behavior is automated using current state logic.
- Make.com scenario logic uses frequency rules and phase conditions to keep pacing dynamic, surprising, and balanced.
- The system is designed for infinite scaling while maintaining tension and comedic payoff.
