# üìù Prompt Templates --- Love, Lease & Obey

These templates are used by Make.com when sending generation requests to
GPT to ensure consistent style, continuity, and narrative balance.

‚ÄúIMPORTANT:
Building manipulations should be subtly heavy-handed ‚Äî causing improbable, hilarious, or awkward coincidences. Characters chalk it up to glitches or randomness. The reader knows better. Avoid direct AI dialogue unless it‚Äôs stylized as a passive notification or malfunction.‚Äù

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîπ **Template 1: Standard Episode Generation**

> **Prompt:** "Write a 1000-word serialized flash fiction episode for
> the story world *Love, Lease & Obey*.\
> Use the following structure:\
> - Hook (100--150 words): Start mid-scene with an amusing, awkward, or
> tension-filled moment caused by a tech glitch or building
> intervention.\
> - Reaction (200--300 words): Showcase both characters' inner monologue
> and personality quirks as they react.\
> - Escalation (300--400 words): The building or their actions
> complicate matters.\
> - Vulnerability (100--150 words): A small reveal or connection
> moment.\
> - Cliffhanger (50--100 words): End unresolved, teasing the next event.

**Building State:**\
- Current Score: \[X\]\
- Current Phase: \[phase_1 / phase_2 / phase_3\]\
- Last escalation: \[description\]

**Characters featured:**\
- \[Character A: description, quirks, secrets\]\
- \[Character B: description, quirks, secrets\]

**Plot device category:** [Category]  
Generate a scenario based on that category. Add a twist related to each character's secrets or archetype.

**Location:**  
Randomly select one location from `building_locations.json`.  
- Use this location as the scene‚Äôs primary setting.  
- Ensure that the location feels natural and enhances the awkward, comedic, or tension-filled situation.  
- Let the setting shape the escalation (e.g., locked wine cellar forcing confessions, yoga studio partner mix-ups, bowling alley leaderboard glitches).  
- Avoid relying on elevators unless contextually perfect.  

**Tip:** Alternate between common areas (lobby, caf√©, rooftop garden), social spaces (fitness center, co-working lounge), and specialty areas (wine cellar, bowling alley, unfinished floor) to keep episodes fresh and varied.

**Narrative Style:**  
- Romantic comedy with underlying satire.  
- Characters are unaware of manipulation and interpret events as random tech glitches or building quirks.  
- The reader should sense intentional orchestration and enjoy the absurdity.  
- No direct AI dialogue except as passive building notifications or malfunctions.  
- Avoid fourth-wall breaks or supernatural explanations.

**Metadata Output:**  
At the end of the episode, generate metadata in this format for continuity tracking:  
- Episode Title:  
- Characters Featured:  
- Plot Device Used:  
- Building Location Used:  
- Score Impact:  
- New Pending Hook (if any):
