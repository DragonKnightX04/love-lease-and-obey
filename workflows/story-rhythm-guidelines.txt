# 📅 Story Rhythm Guidelines — *Love, Lease & Obey*  

This document outlines the recommended pacing and character rotation rhythm for infinite episodic storytelling.  
Following this rhythm ensures character arcs develop naturally, readers feel rewarded with updates, and new tenants are introduced in a controlled, exciting way.

## 🎯 Core Character Rotation Framework

### 🔹 Anchor Characters
- Maintain 3–4 “anchor” couples or key characters who appear regularly.  
- They form the backbone of ongoing arcs.  
- Return to each anchor couple every **3–5 episodes** for progress or tension escalation.

### 🔹 Secondary Characters
- Rotate in secondary couples or new tenants for variety.  
- These characters can be promoted to anchors based on reader engagement or storyline momentum.

## 🕰️ Arc Length Recommendations

| Arc Type              | Typical Length (Episodes) | Key Beats                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Slow-burn romance     | 5–7 episodes             | Awkward start → Escalation → Vulnerability → Partial payoff|
| Rivalry / Enmity arcs | 3–5 episodes             | Initial clash → Building sabotage → Mutual humiliation |
| Secret Exposure arcs  | 2–3 episodes             | Subtle hints → Near reveal → Public fallout |

## 📈 Building-Wide Escalation Events
- Every **10 episodes**, run a mass glitch event (building party sabotage, public leaderboard mishaps, community surveys that leak secrets).  
- These episodes cross multiple arcs and reset tensions.

## 🔎 Summary
- Keep readers engaged with rhythmic returns to characters they care about.  
- Balance fresh chaos with long-term arc progression.  
- Use structured randomness for maximum soap-opera effect.  
- Wildcards create excitement; anchor couples build loyalty.
